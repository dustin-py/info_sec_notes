# Attacks and Exploits

## **Host Discovery**
Scan for live devices on a host.

---
### **Basic Scan**
- `ping <host address>` *think sonar ; icmp echo*
    - ***EX of ping sweep script (.sh)***

            #!/bin/bash
            for i in {1..254} 
            do
                ping -c 1 10.0.0.$i | \
                grep ^64 | \
                awk '{print $4}' | \
                cut -d ":" -f 1 & \
            done 

            ## note: `&` tells it to run in back which means....bash bash go fast fast

### **Scanning with `nmap`**

#### **Types of Scans**
- **Stealth Scan:**
    - Stealth scan switch tag `-sS`
    - This is the default nmap scan.
    - Scans by sending `SYN` packets to a port, if the port responds with `SYN ACK` packet, we drop the connection. This simply gives a basic map of the host network, while not alerting anyone... possibly.

- **Full Connect Scan**
    - Full connect scan switch tag `-sT`
    - This scan performs a full TCP handshake, which means; 
        - **Step1**: attacker sends a `SYN` packet.
        - **Step2**: the live ports recieve the packet then send back a `SYN ACK` packet.
        - **Step3**: attacker recieves `SYN ACK` packet, then sends an `ACK` packet to the live ports, thus completeing the *Three way handshake*.

- **ACK Scan**
    - ACK scan switch tag `-sA`
    - `ACK` scans help map firewalls.
    - Returns weather a port is being filtered or not.
    - Attacker sends an `ACK` packet to a target, attacker either recieves an `RST` packet ,icmp error codes, or nothing. If the port is filtered, the attacker will recieve error codes or nothing.

- **Xmas Scan**
    - Xmas scan switch tag `-sX`
    - this scan sets the `FIN`, `PSH`, and `URG` flags. Lighting the packet up like a christmas tree.
        - **FIN**: alerts that connection is done
        - **PSH**: push this ahead dont buffer
        - **URG**: urgent!! go go go!!!
    - ***FIN SCANS ARE GOOD FOR SLIPPING THROUGH NON-STATFUL FIREWALLS***

- **Fragmentation**
    - Fragmentation switch tag `-F`.
    - help slip through firewall or ids, not getting enough of the packet to hit a rule.

- **Decoys**
    - Decoy switch tag `-D`
    - makes it seem like attacks are coming from another machine.
    - Show activity from you and the decoy

- **Spoofing**
    *set network interface with the `-e` switch first*
    - Spoofing switch tag `-S`
    - spoofing is like decoy except it completly hides the attackers ip and makes it seem like there is only on ip active.

- **Timing**
    - Timing switch tag `-T`
    - allows to set the intesity of scan, fast is aggressive and slow is stealthy.
    - **Options**
        - `T0` paranoid
        - `T1` sneaky
        - `T2` polite
        - `T3` normal
        - `T4` aggressive
        - `T5` insane
