# **Vulnerability Analysis Concepts**
---
## **Theory and Terminology**
Simply vulnerability analysis is just looking for all possible vulnerabilities and report them, where as a full on penetration test is actually testing these vulnerabilities.

### **Vulnerability Management Life Cycle**
1. **Baseline: pre-engagement**
    - The pre-planning phase
    - with baselines we need to figure what the network is like, gather the assets that we need.
    - Gain as much knowledge as possible.
    - Start defining the scope
    - Figure scheduling of when to run assessments.
    - Understand the clients needs.

1. **Vulnerability Assessment: engagement**
    - Scan for known vulnerabilities based on the info gathered.
    - Scanners will do most heavy lifting for us.
    - Also physical vulnerability assessments.
    - Figure out the most problematic vulnerability for client, aka prioritize fixes.
    - Help guid client in the mitigation process.
    - Contextualize these vulnerabilities in a way the client can understand. `ELI5`
    - ***Validate with data science!!***

1. **Risk Assessment: post-engagement**
    - Take discovered vulnerabilities and figure all the risks.
    - Data Science can come in handy here to help tell the story with data and visualizations.

1. **Remediate: post-engagement**
    - Explain ways the vulenerabilities can be patched.
    - Explain ways to prioritize the risks to take care of.
    - ***After Action Reports***

1. **Verify: post-engagement**
    - Verify that the remediations were effective

1. **Monitor: post-engagement**  
    - Watch systems and make sure process and procedures are followed.
